This code is a thin wrapper around boost Asio, making efficient asynchronous tcp network connections easy.

It handles the low-level asynchronous network code for you that is kind of tricky to get right and even trickier to get
optimal performance. It offers an intuitive interface that should cover a lot of use cases especially if you have control
over both the server and the client.

Let me give an example of the interface:

Server
-------

#include "Tcp_connection.h"
#include "Tcp_acceptor.h"
#include <set>
#include <iostream>

//accepts a connection and sends a welcome message
class Acceptor : public Tcp_acceptor<> {
  public:
	Acceptor(boost::asio::io_service& io_service) : Tcp_acceptor<>(io_service) {}
	~Acceptor() {
	    for (std::set<Tcp_connection*>::iterator it = m_connections.begin(); it != m_connections.end(); ++it) {
	        delete *it;
	    }
	}
	
	//overload of the virtual function Tcp_acceptor::read, called any time a new connection is received
	//you take ownership of the connections, so we store them in a set
	void accepted(Tcp_connection* connection) {
		m_connections.insert(connection);
		std::cout << "Accepted a connection" << std::endl;
		std::string welcome_message = "Welcome to the server";
		connection->write(welcome_message.data(), welcome_message.length());
	}
	
	//one of the generated connections is in error
	void error(Tcp_connection* connection, const system::error_code& error_code) {
	    std::cout << "A connection failed: " << error_code.message() << std::endl;
	    delete connection;
		m_connections.erase(connection);
	}
	
	//the acceptor throws an error, this does not mean it will stop accepting connections, just that accepting one particular connection failed
	void error(const system::error_code& error_code) {
		std::cout << "Accept failed: " << error_code.message() << std::endl;
	}
	
	//prints out everython it receives from connections.
	void received(Tcp_connection* connection, const char* data, int size) {
		std::cout << std::string(data, size) << " size: " << size << std::endl;
	}
	std::set<Tcp_connection*> m_connections;
};

int main() {
  boost::asio::io_service io_service;
  Acceptor acceptor(io_service);
  //listen for connections on port 6000-6002
  acceptor.accept(6000);
  acceptor.accept(6001);
  acceptor.accept(6002);
  io_service.run();
  return 0;
}

Asynchronous programming uses callbacks to warn the user that any io data is ready. We need some place for these callbacks to go.
In this case they go to the class Acceptor, derived from from Tcp_acceptor<>. (ignore the template <> for now)

You have to overload the following 4 functions
  obligated:
	1) virtual void accepted(Tcp_connection* connection) = 0;
	2) virtual void error(Tcp_connection* connection, const boost::system::error_code& error) = 0;
	3) virtual void received(Tcp_connection* connection, const char* data, int size) = 0;
  optional:
    4) virtual void error(const boost::system::error_code& error) {}

And you can call the functions
	5) void write(Tcp_connection* connection, const char* data, int size);
    6) void accept(int port);
    7) coid stop_accept(int port);
    
1: This function is called when a connection is accepted. You must take ownership of the connection. If you do not store it somewhere and delete it when you no longer need it, you will create a leak.
2: This function is called when an error happened on a particular connection, such as a disconnect, but many others. This just receives all error codes messages boost asio generates and Maximum message size exceeded.
   We assume in the client here, the error is not recoverable and delete the connection
3: This function is called whenever a connection receives a message. If you use the accompanying client code. Messages written to a connection at one side will come out at the other side unaffected
4: Also the acceptor itself can receives an error. These errors are generally non-fatal, such as unable to bind or a particular accept failed, so we ignore them here.
5: Write to a particular connection, note that you can also use the connection pointer and call write on that write(connection, "hello", 5) is equivalent to connection->write("hello", 5);
6: Start accepting connection on the given port.
7: Stop accepting connection from a port from now on. Allready accepted connections will not be dropped.

This is all there is to creating a high performance asynchronous network application.


This code really shines when you are creating both a client and a server or a combination of both. If you think about it tcp clients and servers are not so different. Both generate
the same bidirectional connections. The server by accepting connections and the client by connecting to a server(s). This library leverages this by providing an identical interface for
both. The only differences between the server above and a client are.

    - You inherit from Tcp_connector<>
    - You call void connect(std::string servernamen, int port) rather than accept.

1,2,3,4,5 are identical. Connectors also generate connections.   

So a client that will connect to the above server looks like this.

Client
-------

#include "Tcp_connection.h"
#include "Tcp_connector.h"
#include "Connection_manager.h"
#include <set>
#include <iostream>

//can connect to server(s) and sends a welcome message
class Connector : public Tcp_connector<> {
  public:
	Connector(boost::asio::io_service& io_service) : Tcp_connector<>(io_service) {}
	
	~Connector() {
	    for (std::set<Tcp_connection*>::iterator it = m_connections.begin(); it != m_connections.end(); ++it) {
	        delete *it;
	    } 
	}
	
	//You take ownership of the connections received here
	void accepted(Tcp_connection* connection) {
		m_connections.insert(connection);
		std::string hello_message = "Hi, I'm a client";
		m_connections.write(hello_message.data(), hello_message.length());
	}
	
	//one of the connctions generated throws an error.
	void error(Tcp_connection* connection, const system::error_code& error_code) {
	    delete connection;
		m_connections.erase(connection);
	}
	
	//the connector has an error, print
	void error(const system::error_code& error_code) {
		std::cout << "Connection failed" << std::endl;
	}
	
	//receives and print out data
	void received(Tcp_connection* connection, const char* data, int size) {
		std::cout << std::string(data, size) << std::endl;
	}
	
	std::set<Tcp_connection*> m_connections;
};

int main() {
  boost::asio::io_service io_service;
  Connector connector(io_service);
  connector.connect("server", 6000);
  connector.connect("server", 6001);
  connector.connect("another_server", 6000);
  io_service.run();
  return 0;
}

And through the magic of multiple inheritance, you can use both in the same application easily. by inheriting from Tcp_connector_and_acceptor<>. You can now generate new connection by
both connecting to servers as accepting connection, making it easy to create peer applications.

Network protocol and framing
-----------------------------

This library provides reliable end to end message transmissions over tcp. To support this, the library needs to know when one messages ends and another begins. Tcp does not provide this
information, it is seen by the application as a constant stream of data. This is known as framing.

By default it does this by sending the size of the coming message as a 4 byte binary unsigned int in network byte order (big endian). This is a variable that can be read across platorm
with the hton (host to network long) and the ntol(network to host long). The message itself can be anything, text, binary data, whatever.

But to provide the possibility to interopperate with some existing protols, it supports 2 compile flags that change this behaviour. The first is DELIMITER (in g++, use -DDELIMITER=\"::\" for a :: delimiter).
If you define a value to this flag is will no longer send the size first but will instead add the given delimiter at the end of every message and remove it again at the other end. It is however now the
responsibility of the user to supply messages that do not contain the delimiter. Or the other end reading the messages will falsely assume to split the message.

The other compile flag is NETSTRING. If defined, the library will use NETSTRING encoding, read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netstring. 

Socket options
---------------

To change socket options on connections, you can just call socket(), to get the underlying socket to change it. If you want to make changes to the socket options of
connections before they are conected, then you can do this by subclassing Tcp_connection, put the things you need to do in the constructor, and pass your new connection type as a template parameter
to Tcp_connector and Tcp_acceptor. They will now generate your connections.

FAQ
----
   
Q: Does it support ipv6 ?
A: Yes, and automatically on all platforms boost asio supports it.

Q: Does it support ipv4 ?
A: Short answer: Yes
   Long answer: On the connector it is no issue, it will connect to whatever the query returns. To understand the acceptors, you need to understand
   a little about how ipv4/ipv6 interopability works. Modern Os's (Vista and onwars, latest version of ubuntu/mac os X) use a hybrid dual stack 
   whoch basically allow ipv4 connection to connect to an ipv6 endpoint. So at the application level you can just open a ipv6 listener and be done with it.
   On older os's that support ipv6 it is implemented using 2 network stacks. On these hosts, this library will open 2 listeners for every accept call to the library.
   One on ipv4 and one on ipv6. So again yes.

Q: I'm getting a compiler error in Tcp_acceptor.h ?
A: There is a bug in boost 1.42 and older that makes the upgrade_to_unique_lock not compile on gcc 4.5 and onwards. (like on ubuntu natty). upgrade to 
   boost 1.46 or downgrade the compiler I guess.

Q: What libraries do i need to link to, which headers should be in my include path, which compiler options do I need ?
A: This library depends on boost asio and should therefor include boost_system (-L/usr/lib/ -lboost_system) and if you define THREADSAFE also, boost_thread. It also needs the boost headers in the include path.
   It is also dependent on the next technical review. (-std=c++0x in gcc). See the Makefile in examples.

Q: Why did you not ship it as a shared library ?
A: Two reasons, users should really take a look at the compile flags and only compile the options they need. Secondly the library is sort of header heavy due to some template usage so there wouldn't be much
   compiled code in the header.
   
Q: The boost asio examples usually use shared pointers, why don't you ?
A: The reason I don't return the pointers in smart pointer is because it is viral. Once a pointer is wrapped in a smart pointer, it is no longer possible to revert
   to a regular pointer ever. Putting a pointer into a smart pointer is very easy. I wanted to give users the option not to use this. That being set, smart pointers
   are a natural fit for event based programming. Event based programming puts more emphasis on paths of execution and less on objects and strict ownership. In fact
   if you use at the implementation you will see smart pointers being used. Getting memory management right with boost asio without them is not easy.
   
Q: Why all the precompiler flags ? precompiler flags are evil.
A: By using precompiler flags, you don't compile what you don't need. And one of the focus points of this project was making it generally be more
   efficient than rolling your own network code.

Q: Is it thread safe ?
A: Using different acceptors/connectors on different io_service is always threadsafe. You can compile the library with the compile flag THREADSAFE to
   make the public interface and multiple event handlers on the same io_service threadsafe. It has however not yet been properly tested, so threat it as
   experimental and inform me of the results.
   
-----

Compile flags:

  Threads:
  
    THREADSAFE 
        If you define this it will make multithread access to the library safe. To actually make event handling multihreaded,
        use a single io_service and a thread pool calling io_service::run().
        
        Note: Different Acceptors/Connectors with a different io_service can be used in different threads without
              the need to compile the code THREADSAFE.
              
        Note: Because all io-calls in the memory are asynchronous, you might not need to enable threading. Boost asio
              in asynchronous mode can service a lot of simultaniously connected sockets from a single thread.

  Network framing:
  
    DELIMITER=\":\"  
        instead of the default length prefix framing, the network code will use the given delimiter
    NETSTRING
        instead of the default length prefix, the network code will use NETSTRING encoding, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netstring
    
  Parameters:
    
    MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE=number_in_bytes
        It is wise to define an upper limit to the size of any message. if you do not do this, you will
        leave your connection vulnerable to DOS attacks. Malicious users just have to send you 1 or a few
        insanely large messages and your application will run out of memory.
        
        NOTE: It is recommended to define this, the default is 1GB, which is probably much larger than desirable.
              The algorithms here are copy once, so it is possible the memory usage of any connection can increase
              to twice this amount.
    
    DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE=number_in_bytes
        Only used with delimiter based framing. This is the initial size of the read buffer. Buffer size will
        increase if larger messages appear and shrink again over time to this value. Even if your messages are
        only small, it will improve performance if you increase this value as we use a semi-rotating read buffer
        protocol and the less rotating the better.
